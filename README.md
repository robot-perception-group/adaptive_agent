```

# Run Agent: SAC, COMP, RMACOMP, PID
- enter the RL workspace
```console
cd adaptive_agent/
```

- start training with 25 environments 
```
python run.py agent=COMP wandb_log=False env=BlimpRand env.num_envs=25  env.sim.headless=False
```

- The experiments are stored in the sweep folder. For example, hyperparameter tuning for the composition agent
```console
wandb sweep sweep/comp_hyper.yml
```
The experimental results are gathered in Wandb.
